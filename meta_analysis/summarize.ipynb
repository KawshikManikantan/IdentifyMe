      "Chapter 1 It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters . \" My dear Mr. Bennet , \" said his lady to him one day , \" have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? \" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not . \" But it is , \" returned she ; \" for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . \" Mr. Bennet made no answer . \" Do you not want to know who has taken it ? \" cried his wife impatiently . \" _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . \" This was invitation enough . \" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . \" \" What is his name ? \" \" Bingley . \" \" Is he married or single ? \" \" Oh ! Single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! \" \" How so ? How can it affect them ? \" \" My dear Mr. Bennet , \" replied his wife , \" how can you be so tiresome ! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . \" \" Is that his design in settling here ? \" \" Design ! Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . \" \" I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . \" \" My dear , you flatter me . I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown-up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . \" \" In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . \" \" But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . \" \" It is more than I engage for , I assure you . \" \" But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him if you do not . \" \" You are over-scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . \" \" I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good-humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . \" \" They have none of them much to recommend them , \" replied he ; \" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . \" \" Mr. Bennet , how _ can _ you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion for my poor nerves . \" \" You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least . \" \" Ah , you do not know what I suffer . \" \" But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . \" \" It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . \" \" Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . \" Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . _ Her _ mind was less difficult to develop . She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper . When she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous . The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley . He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring {{his wife}} (#This is the marked mention) that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it . It was then disclosed in the following manner . Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with : \" I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . \" \" We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , \" said her mother resentfully , \" since we are not to visit . \" \" But you forget , mamma , \" said Elizabeth , \" that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him . \" \" I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . \" \" No more have I , \" said Mr. Bennet ; \" and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . \" Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply , but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters . \" Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for Heaven 's sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . \" \" Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , \" said her father ; \" she times them ill . \" \" I do not cough for my own amusement , \" replied Kitty fretfully . \" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? \" \" To-morrow fortnight . \" \" Aye , so it is , \" cried her mother , \" and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . \" \" Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . \" \" Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? \" \" I honour your circumspection . A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . \" The girls stared at their father . Mrs. Bennet said only , \" Nonsense , nonsense ! \" \" What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? \" cried he . \" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books and make extracts . \" Mary wished to say something sensible , but knew not how . \" While Mary is adjusting her ideas , \" he continued , \" let us return to Mr. Bingley . \" \" I am sick of Mr. Bingley , \" cried his wife . \" I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did not you tell me that before ? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . \" The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though , when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while . \" How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . \" \" Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , \" said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . \" What an excellent father you have , girls ! \" said she , when the door was shut . \" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter . At our time of life it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . \"\n",

Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . \\\" \\\" Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , \\\" said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . \\\" What an excellent father you have , girls ! \\\" said she , when the door was shut . \\\" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter . At our time of life it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . \\\"\\n\\nOptions for the answer:\\nMary\\nKitty\\nMrs. Bennet\\nMrs. Long\\nElizabeth\\nMr. Bingley\\nMr. Bennet\\nLydia\\nNetherfield Park\\nNone of the Above\\n\\nNote that you can select the None of the Above option (The mention refers to: None of the Above), if the mention does not refer to any other entity/option.
